This project will house source code for classrooms (k-12, Higher Ed) of any size that use simple Crestron Automation. This is not intended to replace Custom Designed spaces, but to standardize the cookie cutter rooms we all cut and paste. Our general goal is to create a generic classroom application that can be configured by the user without source code changes. User interfaces will be Keypads and MP series systems with possibly an xPanel as the only graphical interface. By standarizing room automation designers and integrators can deliver a more dependable and robust solution.
